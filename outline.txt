Tools
> i love tools
> i like to build my own to do things like
  - remind me to turn off my time tracking software
  - search a bunch of whois at once
  - ~ 100 bash aliases
  - ** whenever I have to do the same thing twice**

### Front end dev has been painful
- wget your dependencies
or
<video> getting backbone

<slide>
## Enter Bower
manages dependencies for
- javascript
- CSS
- Font Libraries ex. Font Awesome
<video> bower with bootstrap

<slide>
Tons of great things came along
- SASS
- CoffeeScript
- Compass
- Livereload
- Sprockets/Javascript Concat tools

<slide>
## Enter Grunt
Grunt is a task running tool similar to
- jake (javascript)
- make (C, others)
- rake (ruby)

< slide>
<video> uglify with grunt

< slide>
## Common tasks with grunt
- watching for file changes > some action
- compiling SASS or Coffeescript
- restarting you application server
- concatting javascript/CSS files
- whatever the hell you want (easy to make custom tasks)

<slide>
## So what is Yeoman?

<slide>
<grunt image with bower image>
a match made in heaven

<slide>
# But wait... There's MORE!

<slide>
## Yeoman itself is a project generator
- angular express
- Flask (python web framework similar to express)
- laravel PHP framework
- this slide deck (inception?)

<slide>
## So many community plugins
